# PDFConcat licensing and source

Copyright © 2026 Ervins Strauhmanis. Contributors retain copyright in their contributions.

Original PDFConcat source, tests, tooling and accompanying documentation in this checkout are
licensed under the GNU Affero General Public License, version 3 only (`AGPL-3.0-only`), unless
separate terms are identified for a file. See the unmodified license text in [LICENSE](LICENSE).
You may copy, modify and convey this work under those terms. It comes WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY,
including the implied warranties of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE;
see sections 15–16. Third-party components retain their own licenses and notices. This notice
neither relicenses third-party material nor grants exceptions to its terms.

Commercial use is permitted by the AGPL. Charging money, internal business use or offering a
SaaS service does not, by itself, require a paid license. Sections 4–6 govern conveyance of
covered source and object code. Under section 13, a modified version that supports remote
network interaction must prominently offer all users interacting with it an opportunity to
receive its Corresponding Source, without charge, through a standard means of copying software.
The required scope follows the license's definitions; it is not automatically every unrelated
system, service or item of business data. Read the license for the actual conditions.

## Source for this build

Qualified binary releases include `SOURCE.tar.gz` beside the executable archives at
<https://github.com/resoltico/pdfconcat/releases>. It contains the tracked working source
captured for the build, including local modifications, build/install scripts and vendored
module source. Build from stable inputs, add new source files to Git's index before packaging,
and retain the source archive with the binaries. Setup and packaging commands are in
[CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md). The Go toolchain and unmodified general-purpose development
tools are not included. Inspect the complete Corresponding Source requirements for your work.

When conveying modified binaries or deploying a modified work under section 13, replace the
archive and affected notices, include any additional required source/build/install inputs,
and ensure the recipients or interacting users can obtain the corresponding source. An upstream release page, this notice or an unchanged archive does not
satisfy obligations for modifications it omits. Do not include private runtime configuration,
credentials, customer records or database backups in source publications. The archive mechanism
is a delivery aid, not a determination that every deployment meets every license obligation.
